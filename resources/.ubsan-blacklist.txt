# This file is a blacklist for the undefined behavior sanitizer (ubsan). It is not a suppression file (*-ignore.txt).
# The difference is that this file is read at compile-time while the suppression files are read at runtime.
# We cannot use a suppression because UBsan requires -fsanitize-recover to be set for these to work. That flag, in turn
# prevents the exit code from being set, and, as a result the CI from failing if UBsan finds undefined behavior.

# Either a false positive in LZ4 or at least something that we cannot fix ourselves, see
# https://github.com/lz4/lz4/issues/847
