// a) a bunch of disjunctive predicate and union nodes (equivalent to `a = 1 OR a = 2`) if the elements are of the same
//    type, if the `IN` is not part of a `FunctionExpression`, and if one of the following conditions is fulfilled:
//     - Either the right side has fewer elements than MIN_ELEMENTS_FOR_EXPRESSION_EVALUATOR,
//     - or the input node's cardinality is larger than MAX_ROWS_FOR_EXPRESSION_EVALUATOR.
// b) a semi/anti join (with the list of IN values being stored in a temporary table) if the right side has more than
//    MIN_ELEMENTS_FOR_JOIN elements and the elements are of the same type. The exact value of MIN_ELEMENTS_FOR_JOIN
//    also depends on the size of the input data (see #1817). Once this becomes relevant, we might want to add a cost
//    estimator.
// Otherwise, the IN expression is untouched and will be handled by the ExpressionEvaluator.
